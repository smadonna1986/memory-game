Sal's Memory Game

How to Play:
The goal is to match all the cards together and win the game.
Start by clicking on two cards, if they match, look for another pair of cards. If cards are not a pair, try again.

Keep matching up pairs until all cards are matched and faced up.

When the board is complete an alert window will pop up displaying the message Congratulations you win!.The alert window will also tell you your score, time, and moves it took to complete the game. If there is an issue with a single card randomly paired, just hit the restart button on the top right corner of the game.

On the Alert window, you can hit 'Go Again!' to have another go at the game, keep playing for the best score and brag off to your friends.# memoryGame
